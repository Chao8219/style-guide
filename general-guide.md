# 1 Naming Rules

## 1.1 Repo's Name

Repo's Name should be all lower-cased and connecting words with dash "-". Example: "war-is-peace", "chao-is-awesome".

## 1.2 File's Name

There is no strict requirement for file's name since every language has its own file naming rules.

# 2 Documentation Rules

## 2.1 Commit's Comment's Rules

Every comment should be using lowercase letter unless otherwise needed. The basic rule is, the comment title should be as short as possible, and is formatted as "noun" plus "verb past tense" or just "noun". Example: "new functions added", "README updated", "several major improvment uploaded".

The comment details could be as detailed as possible.

One could use: `git commit -m "Title" -m "Details"` to add words in commits.
